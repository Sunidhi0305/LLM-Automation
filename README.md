## ü§ñ LLM Automation Agent

**LLM Automation Agent** is a modular, intelligent system that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to interpret natural language commands and execute corresponding automation tasks. Built for developers, researchers, and automation professionals, this project bridges the gap between conversational interfaces and operational task execution.

### üí° Overview

This agent enables users to interact with computational systems using plain English, removing the need for traditional scripting or manual workflows. It is designed as an extensible framework where tasks, tools, and logic can be customized and scaled to fit diverse use cases ‚Äî from backend process automation to intelligent assistants.
